Stream Example App
------------------

This example app shows you how you can use [GetStream.io](https://getstream.io/ "GetStream.io") to build a site similar to Pinterest.

The application is built using Laravel 5 and Stream-Laravel.

The project is based on the [stream-laravel](https://github.com/GetStream/stream-laravel) integration for [Stream](https://getstream.io/). There is also a lower level [PHP - Stream integration](https://github.com/getstream/stream-php) library which is suitable for all PHP applications.

You can sign up for a Stream account at https://getstream.io/get_started.

If you're looking to self-host your feed solution we suggest the open source [Stream-Framework](https://github.com/tschellenbach/Stream-Framework), created by the Stream founders.

Once you have the right settings you can get your database ready by running the provision command (```./provision.sh```)
